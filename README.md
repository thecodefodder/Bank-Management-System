# Bank Management System

## Purpose

The Bank Management System project was developed to further enhance my programming skills in C#. While exploring various fun projects, I came across this idea and decided to implement it in C to expand my knowledge of the language.

## Code Review

Please note that the code may not meet the highest standards as I am currently in the learning process and still refining my skills.

## How to Test

If you wish to test the Bank Management System, follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

### Linux

```bash
$ gcc main.c -o main
```
### Windows

```console
clang main.c -o main
```

## Usage for Learning Purposes

While it is technically possible to use this project for learning purposes, I would advise against it due to the likelihood of encountering suboptimal code. As I am also in the learning process, the quality of the code may be lacking.
